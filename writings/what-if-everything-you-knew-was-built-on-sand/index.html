        <p><code>First Principles Thinking: A Way Back to Clarity</code></p>
<p><figure class="image-container"><img src="/assets_writings/image3.png"="We live inside assumptions we never chose." loading="lazy"><figcaption>We live inside assumptions we never chose.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Imagine you’re a time traveler.
You land 5,000 years ago, in a quiet village with no electricity, no internet, no government. Just people figuring life out.</p>
<p>You try to explain money.<br>
They look confused. You hold up a ₹500 note.<br>
“It’s just paper,” they say. And they’re right.</p>
<p>You try to explain democracy.<br>
“So&hellip; people vote, and the most popular person becomes the leader?”<br>
They laugh. “That sounds risky.”</p>
<p>That’s when it hits you and you realize something strange:<br>
Most of the things we treat as unshakable truths such as money, government, marriage, even countries are not truths. They’re just <span class="highlight-text">shared stories</span> we’ve all agreed to believe.</p>
<p>And once you see that, you can’t unsee it. We live in systems built on assumptions, not on fundamental truths.</p>
<p>That’s where first principles thinking begins.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-first-principles-thinking-really">What is First Principles Thinking (Really)?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The first principle thinking or reasoning is about dismantling complex ideas, problems, or situations into their most fundamental, undeniable truths and then building up from there as a foundation.</p></blockquote>
<p>First principles thinking is about breaking things down.</p>
<p>You take a complicated idea, a messy problem, or a system and you peel away all the layers until you&rsquo;re left with the bare truths. The kind you can&rsquo;t argue with. The kind that would still make sense to that village from 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Then you start building up again. From scratch. From those truths.<br>
That’s how you get original thinking and not copy-paste logic.</p>
<p>The trick is to think without bringing in baggage. No assumptions. No hand-me-down wisdom. No borrowed thinking.</p>
<p>Here’s a thumb rule to live by:</p>
<p><strong>Say no to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preconceived notions</li>
<li>Assumptions</li>
<li>Analogies</li>
<li>Conventional Wisdom</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of what we treat as “truths” like traditions, governments, money or organizations is actually just a house of assumptions stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>Systems like money, stock market, society, nations, laws, democracy, marriage ..so on are just shared beliefs. They all work well because enough people believe in them.</p>
<p>When you strip away these assumptions and look at the core, often only the laws of physics remain unquestioned. Everything else can (and honestly, should) be questioned.</p>
<p>And that’s the spirit of first principles thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If something can be questioned, it should be.”</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="where-it-all-began-the-origins">Where It All Began: The Origins</h3>
<p>Before diving into it, let’s first understand what we actually mean by “first principle”.</p>
<p>The idea goes all the way back to Aristotle.
He defined it as “the first basis from which a thing is known.” In simple terms, it’s the most basic truth, something that can’t be broken down any further. Something you can&rsquo;t argue with.</p>
<p>Today, we often call it a <em>foundational truth</em>.<br>
That’s not a phrase Aristotle used, but it captures the idea well.</p>
<p>You strip away everything that can be questioned and whatever’s left, that’s your first principle.</p>
<h3 id="first-principle-vs-foundational-truth">First Principle vs. Foundational Truth</h3>
<p>The two sound similar and they are but there’s a subtle difference.</p>
<p>A <strong>foundational truth</strong> is something undeniably true. A basic fact about the world.<br>
Think: gravity exists. Energy is conserved. Water boils at 100°C.<br>
These are like the raw materials of reality.</p>
<p>But a <strong>first principle</strong> is when you take one of those truths and actually use it as a starting point to think from scratch. It’s a starting point for thinking, not just a truth you know but one you build upon.</p>
<p>So, all first principles are foundational truths.<br>
But not all foundational truths become first principles unless you put them to work.</p>
<h3 id="descartes-doubt-and-the-onion-of-truth">Descartes, Doubt, and the Onion of Truth</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to find a foundational truth is through something called <span class="highlight-text">Cartesian Doubt,</span> also known as methodic doubt, a method introduced by philosopher René Descartes back in the 1600s.</p>
<p>It’s the practice of doubting everything that can possibly be doubted in order to arrive at something that you absolutely cannot doubt.</p>
<p>Think of it like peeling an onion.<br>
You keep asking <em>why</em> and <em>how do I know that’s true?</em><br>
Layer by layer, until there’s nothing left to peel.</p>
<p>Descartes noticed that most of what we believe is built on assumptions. So he proposed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let’s doubt <em>everything</em> — our senses, memories, even math — until we find something we cannot doubt.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That led him to a powerful, almost haunting conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Cogito, ergo sum”</strong> — <em>“I think, therefore I am.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Even if everything else is false (the world, my senses, my memories), the very act of <strong>doubting</strong> proves that <em>someone</em> must be doing the doubting.</p>
<p>That someone is <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>It’s deep. You may need to sit with it. But it’s a perfect example of reaching a foundational truth, the kind you can’t go below.</p>
<h3 id="the-litmus-test-is-it-a-real-foundational-truth">The Litmus Test: Is It a Real Foundational Truth?</h3>
<p>Not everything that sounds true is a foundational truth. To check if something really qualifies, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is it undeniably true, no matter what? If there&rsquo;s any way it might not hold up, it’s not a foundational truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can it be broken down further? If yes, keep going. You haven’t hit rock bottom yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it universally and timelessly true (at least within its context)? It should hold true regardless of era, culture, or opinion (again, within its domain).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are examples from different domains:</p>
<p><strong>Physics:</strong>
Truths like gravity, the conservation of energy, or the laws of thermodynamics. These don’t change based on opinions or trends.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics:</strong>
Foundational truths here are called <strong>axioms</strong> (like in geometry or number theory).
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A straight line can be drawn between any two points.” — <em>Euclid</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You don’t prove it. You just accept it as a base layer of logic.</p>
<p><strong>Human Nature:</strong>
These are more observational, but still deeply reliable:</p>
<ul>
<li>People respond to incentives.</li>
<li>Humans crave connection.</li>
<li>Fear and curiosity drive behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>They don’t apply <em>every</em> second, but they’re true often enough to build on.</p>
<p><strong>Business:</strong>
Simple foundational truth is UX:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Friction in checkout flow reduces conversions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something companies learn the hard way and redesign around.</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-most-people-think-this-way">Why Don’t Most People Think This Way?</h2>
<p>The way we think in daily life is often&hellip; pretty flawed.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, our brain wants to save energy, not to waste it thinking deeply. So, it avoids anything that demands too much cognition. That’s why our minds default to shortcuts and patterns because they’re more efficient.</p>
<p>Thinking deeply about just one idea takes time. It drains you. It can feel mentally taxing and uncomfortable. That’s why most people avoid it altogether.</p>
<p>Even I’ve only recently started practicing first principles in everyday life. And let me tell you, it surprises you in ways you can’t even imagine.</p>
<p>So much of what we “know” or “understand” or pretend to understand can’t even survive two levels of scrutiny. If you keep asking <em>why</em>, the truth starts to sway.</p>
<p>Most of it is just borrowed. We never really thought it through. We believed it because someone told us it was true – a teacher, a parent, a friend, a boss, some expert online.</p>
<p>We love collecting information like trophies and put it up on our mental shelf without ever really questioning it. The truth is, we’re always looking for someone to tell us what to do, how to think, what to believe, and what’s right, so we don’t have to do the heavy lifting ourselves.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve built this entire culture around “roadmaps” and “frameworks”. We’ve become addicted to borrowed thinking because we can’t trust ourselves to figure things out from scratch.</p>
<p>And here’s the other uncomfortable truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The systems around us such as workplaces, schools, even society don’t always <em>like</em> people who think from first principles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Questioning assumptions? That shakes people up.
No one enjoys having their beliefs poked.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard phrases like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That’s just how it’s done.”<br>
“It’s always been this way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>These are not explanations. They’re conversation enders.<br>
The subtext?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bro, don’t ask. Don’t be too smart.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And when you do push back with a simple <em>“Why?”</em>, people often get defensive. Because when we’re confronted with our own ignorance, our ego steps in and tries to protect us.</p>
<p>But instead of just accepting “how things are,” ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why is it done this way?”<br>
“What are we assuming here?”<br>
“Is there a better way to do it?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it’s slower. It can feel inefficient.<br>
We humans learn a lot by copying. Copying is faster. Monkey-see, monkey-do is efficient and sometimes that works just fine.</p>
<p>But most of the time, copying blindly leads to mediocrity.</p>
<p>Thinking from first principles is a <em>physics-like</em> way of seeing the world.<br>
You cut through the noise. You stop mistaking tradition for truth.<br>
And once you do that, you start seeing what’s really possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-actually-think-from-first-principles-step-by-step">How to Actually Think from First Principles (Step-by-Step)</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve explored what first principles thinking is and why most people don’t naturally think this way. But how do you actually <em>do</em> it in practice?</p>
<p>At its core, first principles thinking is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deconstruct → Reconstruct</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s about breaking things down to their essence, and then rebuilding from the ground up, free from assumptions, analogies, or convention.</p>
<p><figure class="image-container"><img src="/assets_writings/image3(1).png"="Question. Break. Rebuild. Repeat." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Question. Break. Rebuild. Repeat.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Here’s a 5-step framework to help you apply it in practice:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify &amp; Define the Problem</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Start with clarity. What exactly are you trying to understand or solve?</p>
<p>Frame it as a single, clear sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❝ A well-defined question is halfway to the answer. ❞</p></blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Break It Down to Fundamental Truths</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Decompose the problem into its most basic parts.<br>
Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What are the <em>undeniably true</em> facts here?”</li>
<li>“What’s the <em>physics</em> of the problem?”</li>
<li>“If I strip away all fluff, what’s left?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep peeling the layers by repeatedly asking “why” until you hit something you <strong>can’t break down further</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✦ Tip: Express truths as facts, not analogies or opinions.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Challenge Every Assumption</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, question <em>everything</em>, especially the parts you took for granted.</p>
<p>Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How do I know this is true?”</li>
<li>“What if this assumption is false?”</li>
<li>“What if I did the opposite?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <strong>inversion</strong>:
Flip the problem on its head.</p>
<p>Use <strong>skepticism</strong>:
Treat every belief as guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✦ Tip: Question the tools, the norms, the expectations, even your own thinking.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Rebuild From the Ground Up</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have your first principles laid out, it’s time to reconstruct.</p>
<p>Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Given what I <em>know</em> is true, what can I build?”</li>
<li>“What’s the cleanest, most efficient path forward?”</li>
<li>“Can I combine truths in a new way?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Think like an engineer building from raw materials.<br>
Discard the layers you don’t need. Create something new.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Test, Prototype, Refine</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ideas are only good if they work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run small experiments.</li>
<li>Observe the results.</li>
<li>Refine based on feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Did this solve the core problem?”</li>
<li>“Did it save time, money, or improve quality?”</li>
<li>“Was my reasoning correct?”</li>
</ul>
<p>And don’t forget to question your original question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why did I think that way in the first place? What did I learn from this exercise?”</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="why-use-it">Why Use It?</h2>
<p>Because it sharpens your mind.</p>
<p>It pushes you to think critically about everything you know or think you know and helps you build a solid, personal understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Instead of borrowing ideas from others, you begin to construct your own mental models, your own frameworks, your own worldview.</p>
<p>Here’s why you should practice it in daily life:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Break Biases &amp; Assumptions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We inherit a lot of beliefs from culture, authority, and habits.
First principles thinking helps you strip all that away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❝ It removes the impurities of assumption and convention. ❞</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s left is clean, original reasoning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlocks Creativity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you start from zero, you’re no longer bound by how things “should” be.<br>
You discover paths others miss because they’re stuck in “how it’s always done.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❝ Every layer you break through opens new possibilities. ❞</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplifies Complex Problems</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Big problems can feel overwhelming until you break them into first principles.
From engineering to personal life, this approach helps you zoom into the core and work upward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think small, solve big.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drives Efficiency</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you focus on what <em>actually</em> matters, waste falls away.</p>
<p>You stop overengineering solutions.<br>
You start seeing what’s <em>essential</em>, and doing more with less.</p>
<p>In a world drowning in noise, opinions, information overload, and copy-paste knowledge, this way of thinking becomes a superpower.</p>
<p>It clears the clutter.<br>
It clarifies your path.<br>
And in domains where innovation matters most, it gives you a real edge.</p>
<h2 id="try-this">Try This</h2>
<p>Incorporating first principles thinking into daily life isn’t easy.</p>
<p>Why?<br>
Because for years, we’ve trained our brains <strong>not to think deeply</strong> and to rely on defaults, habits, and borrowed logic. Rewiring that takes effort.</p>
<p>But it’s absolutely worth it.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple challenge to get you started.<br>
Grab a pen and paper. Pick any one of the following everyday questions, and <strong>break it down from first principles</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do we iron clothes?</li>
<li>Why do we eat 3 meals a day?</li>
<li>Why do we use alarm clocks to wake up?</li>
<li>Why do we go to a gym to stay fit?</li>
<li>Why do we go to college to get educated?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips to make this effective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be patient</strong> – It’ll feel slow or awkward initially. That’s normal.</li>
<li><strong>Start small</strong> – Use these simple examples before applying it to bigger challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid analogies</strong> – They can trap you in old assumptions. Stick to facts.</li>
<li><strong>Lean into discomfort</strong> – Challenging your beliefs can feel weird. That’s a good sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is mental weightlifting.<br>
Uncomfortable at first, but the more you do it, the sharper your thinking becomes.</p>
<p>Give it a shot. You’ll be surprised by how deep even the simplest questions go.</p>
<h2 id="final-thought-be-the-one-who-questions">Final Thought: Be the One Who Questions</h2>
<p>First principles thinking lets us question tools that feel “normal”.
That’s where innovation begins.</p>
<p>It’s not just a mental model; it’s a mindset - one that helps you cut through noise, see things as they are, and build ideas that actually make sense.</p>
<p>In a world full of borrowed opinions and surface-level understanding, thinking from first principles gives you something rare:<br>
Clarity. Independence. And the power to truly <em>understand</em>, not just <em>know</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.” ~ Richard Feynman</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it’s harder.
Yes, it takes more effort.<br>
But once you start seeing the world this way, there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
<p>Start small. Stay curious. And keep asking “why”.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thank you!!
I hope it sparked something in you.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just about a way of thinking, but a call to slow down, ask better questions, and reclaim your own understanding of the world.</p>
<p>I’m still figuring it out too, unlearning defaults, challenging what I’ve always accepted, and trying to build sharper clarity one “why” at a time.</p>
<p>If this made you pause, I’d love to know what it stirred up for you.</p>
<p>Until then,<br>
Stay curious, think deeply, and don’t forget to question everything.</p>
